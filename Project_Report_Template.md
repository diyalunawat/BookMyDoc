## Abstract

The abstract for a project is simple, short and can be seen as an overview. It is also like a summary that defines the core of your work. Whether it is literature or science, all papers need some kind of abstract. It will also help the reader understand what you are talking about. Looking at an abstract as a summary will not just make your work easy but also help you write a good one. Always remember that an abstract is not just a summary of the whole paper but also something that could be seen as contributions/conclusions of the work done. To make the abstract more readable thing, make sure to use precise and easily understandable language.

### What is a Literature Review?

A literature review summarizes and synthesizes the existing scholarly research on a particular topic. Literature reviews are a form of academic writing commonly used in the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. However, unlike research papers, which establish new arguments and make original contributions, literature reviews organize and present existing research. As a student, you might produce a literature review as a standalone paper or as a portion of a larger research project.

**Literature Review should be written in paragraph pattern in report and in comparative form in presentation.**
